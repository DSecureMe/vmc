**[VMC](https://dsecure.me)** (Vulnerability Management Center) is a platform designed to make vulnerability governance easier for any security specialists and SOC teams within their organisations. VMC is a great partner in any vulnerability management process, allowing automation and making your life easier. You can integrate VMC with vulnerability scanners and platforms like [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive). Additionally, VMC takes care of asset management integrating with [Ralph](https://github.com/allegro/ralph), whole vulnerability reporting and dashboards ([Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana)) for the clear overview. VMC allows you to focus on the most important vulnerability issues within your environment.

# Value for bussiness
